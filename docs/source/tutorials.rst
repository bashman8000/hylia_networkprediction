Some ML Techniques - Tutorials 
===================================

Classification
**************
Learn how to prepare the data for modeling, create a classification model, tune hyperparameters of a model, analyze the performance, and consume the model for predictions.


Regression
**************
Learn how to prepare the data for modeling, create a regression model, tune hyperparameters of a model, evaluate model errors, and consume the model for predictions.


Clustering
**************
Learn how to prepare the data for modeling, create a K-Means clustering model, assign the labels, analyze results, and consume a trained model for predictions on unseen data.



Anomaly Detection
*****************
Learn how to prepare the data for modeling, create an unsupervised anomaly detector, evaluate the results of the trained model, and consume the model for predictions on unseen data.

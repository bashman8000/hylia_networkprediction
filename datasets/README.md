DATASET| DESCRIPTION | SOURCE
--- | --- | ---
Computer network traffic data | Summary of some real network traffic data from the past. The dataset has ~21K rows and covers 10 local workstation IPs over a three month period.  | [LINK](https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/computer-network-traffic)
Network intrusion detection| The dataset consists of a wide variety of intrusions simulated in a military network environment. It created an environment to acquire raw TCP/IP dump data for a network by simulating a typical US Air Force LAN.  | [LINK](https://www.kaggle.com/sampadab17/network-intrusion-detection)
Anomaly detection dataset| This data is KDDCUPâ€™99 dataset, which is widely used as one of the few publicly available datasets for network-based anomaly detection systems.  | [LINK](https://www.kaggle.com/anushonkar/network-anamoly-detection)
LTE_network_traffic_dataset | Data is information about the traffic of 4G cells (Cell 4G is the radio transmitter to serve the device). 4G cell traffic is understood as: When a user uses a mobile data service, the mobile device will be served by a nearby 4G cell..  | [LINK](https://www.kaggle.com/naebolo/predict-traffic-of-lte-network?select=train.csv)
Road network traffic dataset | The traffic data files for Los Angeles (METR-LA) and the Bay Area (PEMS-BAY)..  | [LINK](https://github.com/chnsh/DCRNN_PyTorch/tree/pytorch_scratch/data/sensor_graph)

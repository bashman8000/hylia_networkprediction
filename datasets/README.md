DATASET| DESCRIPTION | SOURCE
--- | --- | ---
Computer network traffic data | Summary of some real network traffic data from the past. The dataset has ~21K rows and covers 10 local workstation IPs over a three month period.  | [LINK](https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/computer-network-traffic)
Network intrusion detection| The dataset consists of a wide variety of intrusions simulated in a military network environment. It created an environment to acquire raw TCP/IP dump data for a network by simulating a typical US Air Force LAN.  | [LINK](https://www.kaggle.com/sampadab17/network-intrusion-detection)
Anomaly detection dataset| This data is KDDCUP’99 dataset, which is widely used as one of the few publicly available datasets for network-based anomaly detection systems.  | [LINK](https://www.kaggle.com/anushonkar/network-anamoly-detection)
LTE_network_traffic_dataset | Data is information about the traffic of 4G cells (Cell 4G is the radio transmitter to serve the device). 4G cell traffic is understood as: When a user uses a mobile data service, the mobile device will be served by a nearby 4G cell..  | [LINK](https://www.kaggle.com/naebolo/predict-traffic-of-lte-network?select=train.csv)
Road network traffic dataset | The traffic data files for Los Angeles (METR-LA) and the Bay Area (PEMS-BAY)..  | [LINK](https://github.com/chnsh/DCRNN_PyTorch/tree/pytorch_scratch/data/sensor_graph)
Weather Time series datasets |The data are average daily temperatures collected by the weather station 2978 in Helsinki from September 2015 to May 2019.|[LINK](https://rp5.ru/Weather_in_Finland)
Packet traces from WIDE backbone(MAWI) |The dataset consists of a set of labels locating traffic anomalies in the MAWI archive (sample points B and F). The labels are obtained using an advanced graph-based methodology that compares and combines different and independent anomaly detectors.|[LINK](http://mawi.wide.ad.jp/mawi/)
Tcp data from tstat website |The trace contains all TCP flows observed considering a one-hour long time interval. The trace have been collected and made shareable with the support of the mPlane project. In order to respect privacy, IP addresses have been anonymized, and any sensitive information has been removed.| [LINK](http://tstat.tlc.polito.it/traces-tcpcomplete.shtml) 
Traceroute  |The  Traceroute core service collects network path information from our server back to the client IP that initiated the connection. M-Lab uses the Scamper traceroute tool provided by the Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis, CAIDA.|[LINK](https://www.measurementlab.net/tests/traceroute/#traceroute-data-in-raw-format)
NERSC cosmoFlow Datasets |This page describes the latest CosmoFlow dataset, which consists of data from around 10,000 cosmological N-body dark matter simulations. The simulations are run using MUSIC to generate the initial conditions, and are evolved with pyCOLA, a multithreaded Python/Cython N-body code.|[LINK](https://portal.nersc.gov/project/m3363/)
CFDR Data (LANL Datasets) |The data spans 22 high-performance computing systems that have been in production use at Los Alamos National Lab (LANL) between 1996 and November 2005. In total the systems include 4750 nodes and 24101 processors. The data contains an entry for any failure leading to a node outage that occurred during the 9-year time period and that required the attention of a system administrator. |[LINK](https://www.usenix.org/cfdr-data)
HPC-ODA Dataset |HPC-ODA is a collection of datasets acquired on production HPC systems, which are representative of several real-world use cases in the field of Operational Data Analytics (ODA) for the improvement of reliability and energy efficiency. The datasets are composed of monitoring sensor data, acquired from the components of different HPC systems depending on the specific use case. |[LINK](https://zenodo.org/record/3701440#.YL_xXW6p6Al)
Packet headers data(ANT Datasets) |The following datasets are provided by USC/ISI ANT project. They are available through the LANDER project's participiation in the PREDICT program, or on request through the e-mail address listed.|[LINK](https://ant.isi.edu/datasets/all.html)
Perfsonar data set |The set of traces used to perform the analysis of our proposal are logs produced by the OWAMP powstream tool, which measures latency using a continuous stream of one-way tests between two hosts. The logs are from the perfSONAR deployment in the Monitoring Service of the IPÊ network (MonIPÊ). Operated by RNP, this network is composed of 27 Points of Presence (PoPs), one in each Brazilian state.|[LINK](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/MSZVYS)
IP Network Traffic Flows Dataset |The data presented here was collected in a network section from Universidad Del Cauca, Popayán, Colombia by performing packet captures at different hours, during morning and afternoon, over six days (April 26, 27, 28 and May 9, 11 and 15) of 2017. This dataset contains 87 features. Each instance holds the information of an IP flow generated by a network device i.e., source and destination IP addresses, ports, interarrival times, layer 7 protocol (application) used on that flow as the class, among others.|[LINK](https://www.kaggle.com/jsrojas/ip-network-traffic-flows-labeled-with-87-apps?select=Dataset-Unicauca-Version2-87Atts.csv)

## Install
Current installation of Hylia has been tested on Python 3.6. To get started  recommend to first setup a clean Python environment for your project with at least Python 3.6 using your favorite tool ([conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html "conda-env"), [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) with or without [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)).

Once your environment is set up you can install darts using pip:

    pip install hylia
